# Server_Load_Prediction
The project involves the problem of Server Load Prediction on a Dataset containing details of various aspects of a web server running a variety of different software applications.

The dataset consists of a set of variables that were measured over about a one month period. The data is not sequential and each data point can be considered a snapshot of the server state. Given this snapshot, you need to predict whether the server is on low, medium or high load. Measurements were taken in one minute intervals and on each server. They are usually the average or sum over that one minute interval. For instance, the number of packets received, the average number of IO operations, etc.
